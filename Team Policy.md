The following policies are meant to guide members of the team according to their activities and expectations for ongoing work.

- [ ] Each team member will have their own personal repository:
      <LastName_ FirstName_ Work>
   This repository will contain:
      a. Personal notes from project meetings and/or research activities.
      
- [ ] Each team member will pull an updated version of our projects BEFORE pushing any new work to avoid mismatching code conflicts.

- [ ] If a member is unable to attend a team meeting, inform others by email or orally before the day of the meeting. Upcoming scheduled meetings are informed to members by email or orally.

- [ ]  Treat all team members with respect: this goes without saying, but is important nevertheless.

- [ ]  If a member should miss a meeting, other available members will give him/her an update on progress.

- [ ]  Create group meeting notes following every meeting.

- [ ]  Divide project work fairly and appropriately. We should do our best to each put an equal amount of effort into this project.
