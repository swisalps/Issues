The following policies are meant to guide members of the team according to their activities and expectations for ongoing work.

1.  Each team member will have their own personal repository:
      <LastName_ FirstName_ Work>
   This repository will contain:
      a. Personal notes from project meetings and/or research activities.
      
2.  Each team member will pull an updated version of our projects BEFORE pushing any new work to avoid mismatching code conflicts.

3.  If a member is unable to attend a team meeting, inform others by email or orally before the day of the meeting. Upcoming scheduled meetings are informed to members by email or orally.

4.  Treat all team members with respect: this goes without saying, but is important nevertheless.

5.  If a member should miss a meeting, other available members will give him/her an update on progress.

6.  Create group meeting notes following every meeting.

7.  Divide project work fairly and appropriately. We should do our best to each put an equal amount of effort into this project. 

8. Team members will update project Kanban board prior to team meetings, more frequently if particularly active.
